What should you watch out for when working with data?
1. Can the error codes / suppression codes be valid values in some records? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
2. Could the documentation actually be incorrect or out of date? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
3. Line endings matter. @mike-babb 2019 07 30
4. Did the data come from a pc or a *nix operating system? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
5. File encodings always matter. @mike-babb 2019 07 30
6. When was the last time you cleared your memory? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
7. When was the last time you power-cycled your computer? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
8. Is your programming language zero-indexed or one-indexed? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
9. There is a very real difference between ` and '. @mike-babb 2019 07 30
10. Some parts of the world speak a language other than or in addition to English. For example, it's Do√±a Ana County, NM not Donna Ana County, NM. How are your data stored and what does your software recognize? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
11. Update your software and libraries! @mike-babb 2019 07 30
12. That latest software update? What did it break?! @mike-babb 2019 07 30
13. You probably have multiple version of the data file(s). Are you sure you're using the correct one? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
14. It's broken and you have no idea why. Have you stepped away from the task for at least an hour? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
15. They say it's 32-bit. But is your data really? Maybe those negative numbers are coming from an overflow. @mike-babb 2019 07 30
16. They say it's 32-bit. But is your software really? Maybe those negative numbers are coming from an overflow. @mike-babb 2019 07 30
17. You had floats/decimal/double/numeric and then you converted to an integer without explicitly rounding. Yet, things seem off. Some software rounds up. Some down. Some floors numbers regardless. What do you want to happen? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
18. Just what specification of floats/decimal/double/numeric is the software implementing? @mike-babb 2019 07 30
19. It's never too late to check the distribution of a variable. It may surprise you. @mike-babb 2019 07 30
20. Don't store the outcome of a test in the code, store it as a boolean variable. @mike-babb 2019 07 30
21. A series of boolean variables recording the outcome of a series of tests can be incredibly illuminating. @mike-babb 2019 07 30
22. No one has ever been accused of writing too many meaningful comments. Meaningless comments, yes. Meaningful comments, no. @mike-babb 2019 07 30
23. That decision you just made, was it made after your friend invited you out to Happy Hour ten minutes ago and you're ready to call it a day and join your friend? @mike-babb 2019 08 01
24. Just how many get_data() functions have you written? @mike-babb 2019 08 01
25. When was the last time you talked with someone else about what you're doing? @mike-babb 2019 08 01
26. Never forget that 3 months in the lab will save you 3 hours in the library. @mike-babb 2019 08 01
27. It took you about a half-day to write code to proces [80-99]-percent of the data. Just how important is that remaining [1-20]-percent? @mike-babb 2019 08 01
28. You're stuck and not sure what to do. Maybe writting some comments that describe the control flow will help get your brain going. @mike-babb 2019 08 01
29. There is never time or budget to do it right, but there is always time and budget to do it over again. @mike-babb 2019 08 01
30. Creating v1.0 is far more difficult than v2.0 @mike-babb 2019 08 01
31. Your code does something and it generated/cleaned some data. That's v1.0. Check it in, share your results, and code v2.0 tomorrow. @mike-babb 2019 08 01
32. Maybe you can draw some conclusions from the first 10K rows or a 1-percent random sample? @mike-babb 2019 08 01
33. What's the MVP (minimum viable product)? @mike-babb 2019 08 01
34. Learning is stressful. @will-brown
35. Are you sure you removed all duplicates? @mike-babb 2019 08 21
36. What combination of columns makes a row duplicated? @mike-babb 2019 08 21
37. That unique id... is it really unique? Both within a table and across tables? @mike-babb 2019 08 21
38. Yes, the operating system will record the date created and the date modified of a file. And so will a LastUpdate date field in your tabular field. @mike-babb 2019 08 21
39. Be a pal and include a LastUpdateBy. @mike-babb 2019 08 21
40. How big is the chasm between what you think the data are telling you versus what the data are actually saying? @mike-babb 2019 08 21
41. This isn't a dissertation! It doesn't need to be perfect. @mike-babb 2019 08 21
42. Every time you think to yourself, "now that couldn't be the case or that's not realistic," the odds of that being the case just increased to 100-percent. Write that thought down, put it in the sprint backlog, fix it right now, tell a friend, investigate it further. But don't ignore it. @mike-babb 2019 09 11
43. What you don't fix today will be twice as complicated to fix three months from now. @mike-babb 2019 09 11
